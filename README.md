The committee of the Charity shall include the above named officers, as well as 3 (three) extra members. The electronic mailing list is the primary means of communication and activity within the Charity. As the mailing list requires some administration, an ex-officio position of 'list administrator' will be appointed by the committee.

The officers and committee members shall be elected at an AGM or at a special meeting called for this purpose.

Temporary replacements can be appointed at the discretion of the committee.

The standard term of appointment is one year, or until the next AGM, whichever is shorter. If a temporary position is appointed it will arise for reappointment with the other positions at the next AGM.

All officers must qualify under section 16 of the Charities Act, and corresponding forms must be signed to certify this.

This account shall only be used for the purpose of making specific payments via credit/debit card, and only receives the required funds from the jointly operated bank accounts when necessary.

Surplus funds, which are defined as being funds well in excess of the typical operating expenses of the Charity at the appropriate point in time can be invested, however no provision is made within the charter for this at the time of inception and should such a change be required it must be motioned at an AGM or at a special meeting called for this purpose.

The provisions and effect of this clause shall not be removed from this document, and shall be included and implied into any document replacing this document.

## Rule 10
